# Team-Profile-Generator



## Description
Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on
a software engineering team, During this challenge I noticed a bit of our newer concepts like
modularization, breaking the application down into different parts. Testing was something still 
new to me but nice to see how it works! This current challenge is not complete but the progress ive made 
is amazing to me.
